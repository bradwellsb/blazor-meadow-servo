# Blazor and IOT
This sample project was created by [Bradley Wells](https://wellsb.com/csharp/) to demonstrate a technique for controlling connected IoT hardware from a Blazor web app. In this sample, a Blazor client makes HTTP requests to a Maple server running on a Meadow F7 microcontroller board which sets the angle of a servo motor.

This project is accompanied by a blog post tutorial and video.
